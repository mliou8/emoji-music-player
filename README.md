# emoji-music-player

- This is an app where you drag emojis around on a screen. Then when you hit a "render" button, it will render a certain spotify song based on what you moved into the box.		

** Still in Progress **		

To-dos:		
-- List of songs, at least 10 songs that all have a value split (key corresponding)
-- Calculate positions and generate a song based on that.
-- Fix up styling
-- Deploy!


Done:

--- Render a "board" that the emojis can snap onto.		Done
--- Calculate a "code" based on which emojis are where.	Done
--- Plug in Spotify API so that you can pull back previews of a certain song, and render that player somewhere too.		Done


-Bonuses:		
--- Board is a background with colors		
--- Can swap between different boards
-- D3 Visualization of emojis
