This is an app where you drag emojis around on a screen. Then when you hit a "render"
button, it will render a certain spotify song based on what you moved into the box.

** Still in Progress **

To-dos:

-- Render a "board" that the emojis can snap onto.
-- Calculate a "code" based on which emojis are where.
-- Plug in Spotify API so that you can pull back previews of a certain song, and render that player somewhere too.



Bonuses:
-- Board is a background with colors
-- Can swap between different boards
